# Refactoring an open-source Pacman game

Now that you've learned the basic refactoring techniques, how you can make use an IDE and set up an automated code review tool, you are ready to take on a real challenge !

Your task is to refactor this [Pacman remake](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/exercise-pacman) as well as you can. If you don't know where to start, here are a couple of tips:
- Fork the repository
- Open the project in your IDE
- Look at the overall file structure: would you group the files differently, i.e. into packages / folders ? If yes, how ?
- Go through the files: are there dependencies (superclass / interface) and do they make sense ? Which ones would you add / remove ?
- Check if the IDE sees any smells
- Set up the project with Gradle, Travis and Code Climate
- Run a code analysis with Code Climate and any other plugins you added to help you pin-point parts to refactor
- Only refactor small parts at a time, and check that you didn't break anything (either by writing tests before refactoring or by actually running the game)

Good luck ! :smile:
