# Modularity - Intermediate

This time, we will not explain to you why the code is problematic or what you should do. Spot the problems, and refactor the code to avoid them!

Open this folder with your favorite Java IDE and navigate to [src/main/java/App.java](src/main/java/App.java) (or access the file with your code editor).

> :information_source: You can run the code with `gradle run` and test it with `gradle test`.

> :warning: Since we do not instantiate the App class, your functions should be marked `static`.
