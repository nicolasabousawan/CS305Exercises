# Abstractions - Advanced

These open-ended exercises will help you improve your skills at developing good abstractions and fixing bad ones.


## Students

Imagine you are developing an app for students to discover other students who share their interests. How should a student be modeled? Should there be multiple classes to represent them?

Now shift your perspective around: imagine you are developing an app for universities to keep track of their students. How should a student be modeled in this case? Should there be multiple classes to represent them?


## Transportation

One conceptually simple way for a person to travel a long distance is for this person to own a car and use it. However, in real life, there are many other ways people travel, often without owning anything. Think of a few. What abstraction do they provide? What internal details do they hide? What internal details do they _not_ hide?


## Java

Modern programming languages like Java provide an abstraction to the programmer. What is it? What details does it hide? When does it break?


## Your experience

Think of some good and bad abstractions you've seen in past projects. Why were they good or bad for you? How would you have improved the bad ones?
