# Defensive Programming & Code contracts

The exercises are designed such that, if you can correctly solve the Basic exercises every week, then you should be able to get a passing grade on the exams. If you additionally solve correctly the Intermediate exercises, then you should be able to get a very good grade on the exams. The Advanced exercises are for enthusiasts who want go beyond the standard material and get a black belt in Software Engineering. We will be happy to try and provide personalized feedback on your solutions to Advanced exercises if you wish, just send us the info via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSem_4qm_rf22V5--EUrh252_JKcBqoHF1Z67exwPz3tPdOjiQ/viewform).

In this exercise set, you will learn about defensive programming techniques to deliver high quality software by making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected input or user actions, and also about code contracts.
