How the system works:

JokeStore pulls data from a file and stores it into a Joke Object
JokeService will request a joke from Jokestore
    Sometimes it will run into an issue and fail
JokeRepo calls on the service to grab the joke (level of abstraction so you dont have access to the store system)
    The joke repo wants to grab the response from the service but it does not want the joke repo to exceute it right away.
    By storing it into a callback object, the call back will evaluate the response and execute a series of code depending on
    if it is an error or not.
    You can handle the errors at a later time since when the error is thrown it can be stored in call back but it will not
    run until you call the "onError" method

For example:
    I can code my onError method to store my error in another variable and hold off.
    From there I can grab my error at a later time (maybe after all the code is executed) and
    say something about the error
    Same thing with on success- maybe I do not need the value right away and can use the onSuccess method to store the value
    from there I can call it at a later time
