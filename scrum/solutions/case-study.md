# Solution: Scrum case study

## Day 1
Advice Mally to help them switch to a git repository for their code base. Git is a very powerful versioning tool and expresses its whole power especially when working in team. Git will help them working simultaneously on their code without having the upload problem any more.
For now they need to wait on others to upload changes before they can work. This means that only one developer can work on the project at a given time: what a loss of productivity! Furthermore, they absolutely need to communicate before getting the code to be sure that the last worker has uploaded everything. It is a real mess and Git would save them.


## Day 2
Mally should begin by talking to all developers and writing down what everyone is working on. Then she should write each task either in the Sprint Backlog or in the in-progress bucket. This would allow the team to have a good vision of the project's goal and progress as everyone would know on what the others are working and see the tasks they have done so far.


## Day 3
The stand-up meeting. During this meeting everyone says:
1. What they did the day before
2. What they will do today
3. What is blocking them, what are the problems they encountered

It is important that the developer does not go too much into implementation details but keeps it short.
All members stay standing to encourage the meeting to be short. It is always possible to continue talking about something after the meeting.


##Â Day 7
There are plenty of tools to let you do this like Github projects, Trello, Jira. Even non-digital things like a classic white board in the office.

In this tool (or white board), every feature needs to be explained as a user story: "As a `<user-type`>, I can do `<feature`> to achieve `<goal`>". This helps removing any implementation details from the product backlog and keep focused on features visible by the client.


## Day 24
This is the Sprint Review. During this meeting, the whole team will meet the Product Owner (Tom) and the stakeholders (customers). The team will go through what has been done, what has not and will do a demo to the customers. After the demo, the team will collaborate with the customers to decide what will be done next.


### Planning
This is the Sprint Planning. During this part the team will choose how many and which user stories from the Product Backlog will be in the Sprint Backlog. The Product Owner (or customers) can only prioritize in the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog is managed by the team.


## Day 27
Mally needs to say no to Tom, we cannot change the sprint backlog during the sprint. She is taking the role of Scrum Master, she needs to check that the team is not doing tasks that are not in the Sprint Backlog.


## Day 34
Rose has to communicate this to Mally and Tom. She cannot take the decision on her own (in most cases), even if the bug is severe. There are many possible ways to handle the situation. For example:
- The bug is minor and can be fixed right away while you're doing some other work in the same code. You can just fix it.
- Log the bug into the issue tracking system you use.
- Log the bug and raise an alarm to the Product Owner and the Scrum Master.
- The bug is severe enough for you to believe it has to take priority over anything else: Then, log it, communicate with the Product Owner and the Scrum Master and move away other items in the Sprint Backlog.
