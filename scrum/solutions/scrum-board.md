# Possible solution to the Advanced exercise

   
4. Create 3 User Stories as notes in the Product Backlog.
    - Q:Who should be updating the Product Backlog? 
    - A:The Product Owner is responsible for populating the Product Backlog and prioritizing it according to their own criteria.
    - Q:What is the format of a User Story?
    - As a 'type of user' I can 'do this' in order to 'accomplish that'
5. Place one of the User Stories in the Sprint Backlog.
   - Q: Is testing a separate task or is it a part of each tasks?
   - A: This is a choice that the Development Team has to make. Testing can be _recorded_ in the Board either ways.
   - Q: Who pulls items from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog? How do you determine how many items to put there?
   - A: The Development Team decides how many User Stories to pull into the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint Planning session. They have to decide how much work they can accomplish for the duration of the Sprint according to their estimations and historical data (sometimes referred to as _velocity_.) The amount of time required for the User Stories should always be less than the total amount of time, it does not need to be exact. For example, 3 developers working 8 hours per day for a Sprint of 5 days makes 120 hours. If the top 6 User Stories take 125 hours, then the Development Team has to take only the top 5 User Stories (from the Product Backlog) even if these 5 User Stories make up only 100 hours.
6. Create issues for tasks in the descriptions of the User Stories.
   - Q: Where should you place these tasks?
   - A: In the Sprint Backlog, this is the decomposition of User Stories into tasks.
7. Imagine you have team mates, how would you assign the Tasks in the Sprint Backlog to the different people on the team?
   - Developers should self-assign
8. Where do you put bugs?
   - In the Product Backlog. The Product Owner should prioritize the bugs along with the other Items in the Product Backlog.
