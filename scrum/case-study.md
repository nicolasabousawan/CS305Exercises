# Once upon a time

Once upon a time there was an EPFL student called Mally, who has just passed the Software Engineering course with an excellent grade.
Mally knew all about the modern software engineering practices and had just gotten a summer internship at Elka Inc.

Elka Inc. was trying to switch to Scrum as a way to run their development and Mally had to help them do the transitions.
You are a friend of Mally and both of you know that helping out fellow developers is good (except during exams, which you would never do anyway).
So let's see what questions Mally has for you during the first couple of weeks of the internship.

Tom is the project manager who helps Mally understand the situation in the team and the development team is friendly and wants someone to be in charge of the transitions to Scrum.
Tom talks to direct users of the website that Mally will work on and is not a developer.
Mally doesn't have to worry about the team not collaborating but the changes have to be smooth and slower than just saying "We do Scrum from tomorrow".
People resist change if it's too abrupt, and Mally knows that.


## Day 1 Where is the code repo?

As Mally walks into the room where Tom, the project manager, told Mally to go there are 7 people who type on keyboards and sip their morning coffee.
Mally's desk is the one next to a window right next to the only QA engineer of the project.
Tom told Mally to get the instructions on how to get the source code from the engineers around and left.

> Mally: Hello folks! I'm wondering who can help me with the source code. Where can I get it from?
> 
> Alex (the QA): We have a folder on our file server that has the code, download it from there. (...) No, wait! Hey, Jim, did you upload your changes?
> 
> Jim: No, I'll upload now. Wait for a couple of minutes, it takes time to upload everything on that cranky old server.

**What would you advice Mally to do first?**

### At some point during the day

As everyone works on something on their own, Mally doesn't know what to do and asks Tom where to find a task list of some sort.

> Tom: Well, you see, Mally, the team has been around for so long, I don't know what they do day-to-day. I know that every so often they update the website with some new features but the team is in charge of deciding what to work on. 
>
> Mally: So how do you know that the customers want what the developers are doing?
>
> Tom: We don't actually know except that soon we will have support for tablet devices. Currently the layout is not updating on different resolutions. We will also get a QR code that's gonna let people easily link to their profile.
>
> Mally: I think I can do something about it to get us closer to our goal to use Scrum. 

**How can Mally get the tasks of the team and where would he put them?**


## Day 2 So what did you do?

During the day Mally saw that there are emails from all developers when they finish their task.
The email would say which files the developer has modified and that the changes are now on the file server (Mally's solution for this problem is still not solved, it will happen next week).

```
from dev2@elka.com
Subject: <width of the main content box: done>
Body: 

Hey,

I've updated styles.css and MainActivity.java.
I need to do a bit more fiddling to fix the weight of the menu when it opens but the main content looks fine and it's scrollable!!!

Cheers,
dev2
```
Mally still updates the Sprint Backlog but now adds one more bucket: Done.

**How can Mally help developers communicate easier? What is the Scrum activity whose purpose is to facilitate this? What do people do during this meeting?**


## Day 7 Mally to the rescue

The sales for the website licenses are failing and Tom is worried that his people will get fired. John, one of the quiet developers who Tom knows the least, looks like the target.

>Alex: Hi John, you have to go talk to Tom, man! He's under the impression you didn't do anything since forever.
>
>John: But I don't know how much everyone else has done. Maybe he's right.
>
>Mally (overhearing the conversation): Well, I actually know how much work you've done. I've started logging in all the emails in this tool. Here, you have completed 3 tasks since I started and all the others have done 2.5 tasks on average per person, so you've actually done more than the rest.
>
>Alex: You should show this to the rest of the team, we should use it instead of those tedious emails.
>
> Mally: Yes, especially since we don't use the file server anymore, everyone can commit code in the version control system.
>
>John: Mally, please, can we go with you to Tom and show him this. I'm still worried I might be fired but so relieved you did this to show people outside of the team what we do.

**How can the team use the Sprint backlog, the in-progress and done lists that Mally has created? What tools are there to manage this? What format should the items in these buckets be?**


## Day 24 Time to show off

Mally is very happy with the internship.
The work is challenging but rewarding, the team accepts Mally as one of them, and Tom helped Mally set up the Scrum dashboard once the team decided what they wanted to use.
However, Mally only has 3 months in the company and wants to deliver things in time.
The tablet resolution and the QR code features are done and the team will deploy the new website in 3 days.
Mally has an idea to show the website to Tom and other stakeholders and understand what they would want to be delivered in the next 2 weeks.

**What could this idea be? How is the meeting that Mally wants to set up done and who is in the room during the meeting? How would Tom be called in Scrum terms?**

### After the show is over, time to plan

The team gathers and after Tom and the others saw the current website and by Mally's suggestion arranged the new Product Backlog with all the different User Stories that they will want to see implemented in the website.
Now, Tom is available for one more activity.

**What is it that the team will do now? Who and how do they decide how many User Stories are in the Sprint Backlog?**


## Day 27 Mally has a new role

Just a couple of days after the Sprint has started Tom walks into the room with a request. 

> Tom: Hey team! Listen up, I need someone to do the user story for this "save the preferences for the theme". Ken from sales says people are really unhappy about not having it right away.

**What is Mally's response to this? What role is Mally taking when saying this? What do this person do during the Scrum process?**


## Day 36 It's definitely a bug and not a feature!

The day is great and all goes well, but Rose has a problem: she was working on a new user story to implement a map view for all friends in the friends list of a user, when she stumbled upon a database error when clicking on the friends list in the profile of the user. 

>Rose: Hi everyone! Can you please check if you can click on the list of friends from your profile page?
>
>Mally: I get an error!
>
>Alex: Me too!
>
>Rose: Should I fix this while I'm at it? Mally, what happens to our Sprint?

**So what happens to the Sprint? Should Rose fix the bug? What should she consider and who should she talk to?**


## The Last Day

As the end of Mally's internship approached, everyone gathered in the office to share a moment together, eating cake and celebrating the transition to Scrum that Mally helped the team achieve. Tom also had a surprise.

>Tom: Mally, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
>
>Mally: Of course! 
>
>Tom: First, you did a great job! Thank you again for helping us out!
>
>Mally: It was a great experience, I learned a lot here!
>
>Tom: I have an offer for you. Do you want to stay and be a part of the team?

~~ The End ~~
