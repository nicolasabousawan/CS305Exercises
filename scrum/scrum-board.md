# Scrum Board

With this exercise, you will learn how to manage the Scrum process in GitHub.

1. Create a new repository.
2. Go to the Project tab and create a new project.
3. Create 4 columns: 
    - Product Backlog
    - Sprint Backlog
    - In progress
    - Done
4. Create 3 User stories as notes in the Product Backlog.
    - Who should be updating the Product Backlog? What is the format of a User Story.
5. Place one of the user stories in the Sprint Backlog.
   - Convert it to an issue
   - Include in the body of the issue a description with details what exact tasks the User story consists of (example: implement a class User, create a front end for the profile page, test front end, test back end)
   - Is testing a separate task or is it a part of each tasks?
   - Who pulls items from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog? How do you determine how many items to put there?
6. Create issues for tasks in the descriptions of the User Stories.
   - Where should you place these tasks?
7. Imagine you have team mates, how would you assign the Tasks in the Sprint Backlog to the different people on the team?
8. Where do you put bugs?
9. Search for alternative methods to manage the Scrum board (Milestones, labels, etc.) 
   - What are the pros and cons of the different ways?
   - What combinations of techniques can you imagine?
   - Who has the responsibility of updating the board?
   - When should you decide on a tool to use?
