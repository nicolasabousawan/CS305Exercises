# DP 1 / Exercise 1

You are the proud owner of a modern pizza shop, and you wrote the following code to make pizza (see [`Pizza.java`](Pizza.java) for what a pizza is):

```java
Pizza orderPizza() {
		Pizza pizza = new Pizza();
 
		pizza.prepare();
		pizza.bake();
		pizza.cut();
		pizza.box();
		return pizza;
	}
```

But, to be competitive, you need to be able to bake more than one type of pizza. So you add some code that determines the appropriate type of pizza and makes it:

```java
Pizza orderPizza(String type) {
		Pizza pizza;
 
 		if (type.equals("cheese")) {
 			pizza = new CheesePizza();
 		} else if (type.equals("greek") {
 			pizza = new GreekPizza();
 		} else if (type.equals("pepperoni") {
 			pizza = new PepperoniPizza();
 		}

		pizza.prepare();
		pizza.bake();
		pizza.cut();
		pizza.box();
		return pizza;
	}
```

You realize that your competitors have added a couple of trendy pizzas to their menus -- Clam Pizza and Veggie Pizza -- so you add these items to your menu. Since your Greek Pizza doesn't sell well, you also decide to take that off the menu. So now you have [`CheesePizza.java`](CheesePizza.java), [`ClamPizza.java`](ClamPizza.java), [`PepperoniPizza.java`](PepperoniPizza.java), and [`VeggiePizza.java`](VeggiePizza.java).

Unfortunately, this kind of changes are likely to keep occurring, and it will be a mess to deal directly with these concrete class instantiations.

How can you make this code more elegant using a factory design pattern? Is the [Static Factory Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFReASujY&feature=youtu.be&t=1m5s) or the [GOF Factory Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFReASujY&feature=youtu.be&t=6m20s) (i.e., virtual constructor) better suited? Rewrite the code to use the chosen factory.

**ANSWER:** The [Static Factory Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFReASujY&feature=youtu.be&t=1m5s) is better suited in this case. Indeed, the goal here is to gain control over object (pizza) creation. This is achieved by delegating object creation from the constructor to static methods which act on behalf of the constructor.<br>
Furthermore, using static methods make the code more readable as it is more verbose.
